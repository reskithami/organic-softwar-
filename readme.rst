Organic software is an attempt to build applications quickly. In this example I developed a point of sale, in less than 2 weeks. While building the concept and the tools it took me less than two weeks to finalize this project. Of course I use a lot of code from github.

This application is like an attempt to develop modeling. A kind of model construction. It consists of many fully autonomous modules assembled on a brain constructor.
The page constructor, for the bulk of the application and admin constructor, for admin part .-).

It is provided with a generator of module based on an existing generator.
In the next version, I would use the very good library groceryCrud which seems faster and more efficient.

For installation, you just create the data base and edit the url in the file application / config / config.php 
the library used are Ion_auth and Bcrypt.
Have fun
